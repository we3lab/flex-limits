Bulk power cost (BPC) means those costs during the calculation period related to the purchase of wholesale power and the ownership of generation. 

Bulk power cost true-up (BPCT) means the difference between the bulk power cost actually incurred and the bulk power cost recovered through the power cost base and the bulk power cost adjustment may be deposited in or removed from a true-up account, as applicable. The BPCT is that portion of the true-up account to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. 

Rate stabilization fund adjustment (RSFA) means funds to offset sudden and/or temporary changes in the cost of power may be deposited in or removed from a rate stabilization fund, as applicable. The RSFA is that portion of the rate stabilization fund to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. 

System loss factor means the factor applied to adjust the bulk power unit cost from a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of purchases to a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of sales. 

Power cost base means the bulk power-related cost that is embedded within the base retail rate, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour. The energy charge includes a power cost base of $0.060150 per kwh in the base rate. 

Bulk power cost adjustment (BPCA) means the difference between the adjusted bulk power unit cost and the power cost base, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour, as determined by the calculation. This is also referred to as the purchased power/fuel adjustment factor."

thirty percent (30%) and is deemed eligible for service under the tariff, then the
Customer can remain on the schedule even if the Customer&#65533;s Load Factor subsequently
falls below thirty percent (30%). Eligibility qualifications for new construction for

Available to General Service Customers for electric service who are located on the Company's
distribution lines suitable and adequate for supplying the service requested, subject to the conditions
set forth in this Rate Schedule and the Company Rules.

CHARACTER OF SERVICE
The Company will supply service from its electric supply lines at only such frequency, phase,
regulation, and one standard secondary voltage or the available primary voltage in the location where
service is required. (See Company Rule 3 for the Company's standard voltages.)
When the Customer under this schedule elects to take service through separate meters the readings of
such meters will not be combined, but will be computed separately under this schedule for each meter
supplied. When the customer desires combined metering the customer shall provide upon his own
premises and at his own expense the proper insulating transformers, regulators, and other equipment
necessary to split the service. Load shall be balance between phases, if in the judgment of the
company such balancing is necessary.
For Customers utilizing thermal storage, the Customer must arrange the wiring for the thermal
storage equipment to permit the measurement of the demand and energy use of such equipment by
suitable metering equipment as specified by the company. The company shall at all times, have the
right to inspect such metering to insure that such service metered is exclusively thermal storage use.

DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF ELECTRIC SERVICE SUPPLIED
The electric service to be supplied under this rate shall be measured as to Maximum Demand and
Energy consumption by an IDR Meter or a DI Meter to be installed by the Company.

Demand Charge
$228.80 per month for the first 10 kilowatts or less of Maximum Demand per month
$9.88 per kilowatt per month for all over 10 kilowatts of Maximum Demand per month

MONTHLY MINIMUM CHARGE
The Customer's Monthly Minimum Charge under this rate shall be equivalent to the Monthly
Demand Charge applicable to 80% of the highest Billing Demand of the previous twelve months,
provided however, that in no case shall the Monthly Demand Charge be less than $228.80.

DETERMINATION OF MAXIMUM DEMAND
Customer's maximum demand in any month shall be determined by maximum demand instruments.
The maximum demand of electric energy supplied in any month shall be taken as the highest average
load in kilowatts occurring during any 30 consecutive minutes of the month; provided, however, that
if such load shall be less than 50% of the maximum momentary demand in kilowatts, then the
maximum demand shall be taken at 50% of such maximum momentary demand. However, for
Customers utilizing thermal storage, the maximum demand shall be limited to the greater of the
actual maximum demand occurring during the On-Peak period or 50% of the maximum demand
occurring during the Off-Peak period."
