**analysis**: Contains functions and classes that are used to run different analysis using the flexloadMILP model. 
- `acc_curve.py`: Computes the pareto curve between cost and emissions optimal objectives.
- `emissionscost.py`: Calculates the shadow cost of emissions abatement.
- `energy_capacity.py`: Evaluates the effect energy capacity as a function of uptime, power capacity, and RTE.
- `maxsavings.py`: Computes the maximum savings given energy flexibility characteristics and a region/month.
- `overlay_costs.py`: Calculates effective renewable energy credit prices + overlays that with the SCC on plots.
- `pricesignal.py`: Loads and reformats timeseries data from the **data** folder. 
- `rte_analysis.py`: Calculates the effect of RTE<1 on the savings.
- `shadowcost.py`: Similar to emissionscost, an alternative method of calculating the shadow cost of emissions abatement.

**data**: Contains cleaned data on electricity prices and emissions. 
- `aef/`: contains data on average emissions factors, sorted by region in month-hour-average format.
- `dam/`: folder not available. Day ahead market prices are excluded from the public repository but can be found via GridStatus. 
- `mef/`: contains data on average emissions factors, sorted by region in month-hour-average format.
- `offsets/`: contains information on estimates of renewable energy credit pricing and projections for the social cost of carbon. 
- `tariff/`: contains data on retail electricity tariffs (rate structures). An example is chosen for each region that is suitable for a 1MW load. A full list of tariffs is contained in the subfolder `bundled/`. A maintained list of industrial tariffs can be found in [this dataset](https://github.com/we3lab/industrial-electricity-tariffs).
- `tariff_wwtp/`: a subset of the `tariff/bundled/` folder that was used in an [initial study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02886-6) of electricity rates in the water sector. 

**models**: Contains a model file that represents the flexible load and is used for analysis.

- `flexload_milp.py`: contains the *flexloadMILP* class which builds a pyomo optimization model constrained based on the flexibility characteristics. 

**paper_figures**: Contains all code, figures, and data associated with figures in the published manuscript. 

- `code/`:
    - `acc_curve_wholesale_vs_tariff.py`: used to plot the pareto optimal curve between cost and emissions objectives. Manuscript figure 4.
    - `colorscheme.json`: Colors to be used across all plots.
    - `designspace_plot.py`: Used to map the uptime-power capacity space and plot example systems. Manuscript figure 1.
    - `energy_capacity_analysis.py`: Visualizes the effect energy capacity as a function of uptime, power capacity, and RTE.
    - `marginal_abatement_cost.py`: used to plot the cost of abatement associated with points on the pareto curve. Manuscript figures 4 c,d.
    - `maxsavings_boxplot.py`: plots the box plot associated with the range of savings from optimal flexibility. Manuscript figure 3. 
    - `maxsavings_contour.py`: plots the maximum savings as a function of uptime and power capacity. Manuscript figure 2. 
    - `rte_analysis.py`: plots the effects of RTE<1 on the maximum savings.
    - `shadowcost_contour`: plots the cost of abatement as a function of uptime, power capacity, and fractional abatement.
    - `shadowcosttariff_violinplot.py`: plots the cost of abatement associated with flexibility when considering tariff electricity pricing. Manuscript figure 5b. 
    - `shadowcostwholesale_boxplot.py`: plots the cost of abatement associated with flexibility when considering day-ahead market electricity pricing. Manuscript figure 5a. 
- `figures/`: contains subfolders for 3 supported image file types: `pdf`, `svg`, and `png`. Each contains several versions of the plots generated by the aforementioned code.
-  `processed_data/`: Contains data associated with each of the `figures/`.
